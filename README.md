# 4-BIT-SEQUENTIAL-MULTIPLIER
The 4-Bit Sequential Multiplier is a hardware design implemented using Verilog HDL to perform multiplication of two 4-bit binary numbers using sequential logic. The project includes modular components such as a multiplier register, multiplicand register, control unit, adder, and shift register, ensuring an efficient and structured design. A testbench is provided for simulation and verification, enabling users to test the functionality with various cases. The design is compatible with simulation tools like ModelSim or Vivado and can be extended for FPGA implementation. Future enhancements include extending the design to larger bit widths, optimizing for speed and area, and exploring pipelined or parallel multiplication.
